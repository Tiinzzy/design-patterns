### Factory Pattern
Creates individual objects of a specific type through a common interface, allowing subclasses to determine the exact class of the object.


### Abstract Factory Pattern 
Creates families of related objects without specifying concrete classes, ensuring compatibility among the objects created within a family.


### Factory vs Builder Design Pattern 
The Factory Design Pattern creates objects through a common interface, while the Builder Pattern constructs complex objects step by step, allowing different representations to be created.
